# Speck

The Expense Tracking App that your friends need.

## Description

Ever gone out with the boys and realized that everyone paid for different things during the night, week, or even month? If you're a broke guy in their 20s like me, then you know the pain of calculating everything, who owes who what and all that. Constant Zelle's and Venmo's to each other to ensure everyone is paid. It gets annoying, and usually put off for weeks. 

Speck aims to solve this problem by simply calculating these expenses for you, as well as splitting for you!
