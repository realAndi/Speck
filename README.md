# Speck

The Expenses tracking and Group Saving app

## Description

Ever gone out with some friends, and one of you decide to pay for the bill? Maybe you guys decide to go somewhere else and somebody else handles the bill. Perhaps the 3rd guy paid for everyones Uber. And the 4th guy was a wild card. Calculating who owes what gets annoying and it isn't something we look forward to. Speck aims to make that issue go away by tracking and dividing expenses for you!

## To Do / Development Road Map:

* Set up organization creation / joining
* Set up expenses tracking
* Make pretty graphs
* Set up user roles per organization
* Introduce user profiles
* Pretty up everything
